# Movie Night
*What should we watch?* <br>

The age-old problem before engaging in a successful movie night is deciding and _agreeing upon what to watch_.

IMDB allows users to cultivate a "Watchlist" of titles that they wish to revisit, view, and share.
As more people create accounts on the site and actively engage in updating their watchlists, programs to analyze and compare data can be effectively implemented. 

**Current**:  
- A simple program that compares 2 .txt lists and prints the commonalities

**Goals**:    
- Import Watchlists directly from IMDB (account login) <br>
- Compare 2+ lists
- Customizable advanced searches
  - *Genres*
  - *non-IMDB searches*
  - *Web App with standalone content*
